                        5. Mishima: A Life in Four Chapters</a></h2>
    
                    <p> Directed by Paul Schrader, Mishima: A Life in Four Chapters is a colorful biographical drama that portrays the life of Japanese author and playwright Yukio Mishima. The film takes place on the last day of Mishima's life and is composed of extended flashbacks to Mishima's earlier years along with stylized adaptations of his fictional writing. The soundtrack to this film features music written by Philip Glass and parallels the different visual styles of the movie. What capitvates me the most about Mishima is the vibrant colors and set design, and the score does nothing except enhance these other-worldly scenes. The music is emotional and saturated, but is still a great option for when you are trying to listen to good music but not be too distracted by it. <br>

                 <h2><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Brother-Where-Art-Thou/dp/B003V5CFV8">4. O Brother, Where Art Thou?</a></h2>
 
                 <p> O Brother, Where Art Thou? was directed and produced by Joel and Ethan Coen (commonly referred to as the Coen Brothers) in 2000. It is a comedy-drama which loosely adapts Homer's epic <i>The Odyssey </i>into a story that follows three convict and their escape from their imprisonment. The trio eventually meet up with Tommy Johnson, a young black guitarist and form a band call the Soggy Bottom Boys. They then go on the lam, traveling throughout Mississippi trying to remain anonymous while their fame as the Soggy Bottom Boys grows bigger than they could've anticipated. The music in this movie is so instrumental to the story-line, and therefore part of my love for the soundtrack comes from my love for the movie. If you haven't heard this soundtrack yet I highly recommend a listen since each song is the perfect mix of bluegrass, country, gospel, blues, and folk music.<br>

                    <p> Stanley Kubrick's iconic 2001: A Space Odyssey came out in 1968 and was inspired by Arthur C. Clarke's 1951 story "The Sentinel". Overall the movie displays the curiosity of mankind, as Kubrick was determined to show the entire arc of human life. Since the majority of the 164 minute long film has no dialogue in it, Kubrick relies on the score to evoke certain moods. The scores in Space Odyssey is iconic and always transports me into a dream-like state. Since Kubrick relied so heavily on these scores, whenever I listen to them I am heavily reminded of my initial viewing experience of 2001.

                    <h2> <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/rushmore/id516950090">2. Rushmore</a></h2>
    
                    <p> Rushmore is a comedy-drama directed by Wes Anderson in 1998. The film follows teenager Max Fischer and rich industrialist Herman Blume as they both fall in love with one of the teachers at Rushmore (Max’s school), Rosemary Cross. Max and Herman essentially go to war trying to claim the right to be with Rosemary, with Max appearing as a reckless liar willing to manipulate anyone to get what he wants. The angst that Max feels is reflected through the soundtrack, with songs by The Rolling Stones, The Kinks, and The Who. Anderson utilizes certain songs to mimic the point of tension between Max and Herman, playing “A Quick One While He’s Away” at the height of Max and Herman’s tension, then playing John Lennon’s “Oh Yoko!” when they come to a reconciliation. The Rushmore soundtrack is a great soundtrack for when you want to feel like you are living in a different reality, with the perfect mix of french music and rock.

                    <p> The Royal Tenenbaums is another Wes Anderson movie that came out in 2001 and stars Danny Glover, Gene Hackman, Bill Murray, Gwyneth Paltrow, Ben Stiller, and both Luke and Owen Wilson. The film follows the lives of three gifted siblings who are all child prodigies: a young playwright, a real-estate mogul, and an expert tennis player, who all face grave failures in their adulthoods. The family comes together when their father, Royal Tenenbaum, who was previously estranged from the children, claims he has a terminal illness. The soundtrack of The Royal Tenenbaums features songs from artists like The Velvet Underground, John Lennon, and the Ramones (a common feature in all of Anderson’s films), along with scores composed by Mark Mothersbaugh. This is a really good soundtrack to listen to when you want the perfect mix of nostalgic indie/rock music along with scores that will make you feel like you are in the movie yourself.  <br>
