    <h1>Readings I Have Found to be Influential</h1>
    <p>This is a collection of excerpts that I have read over my time at Parsons that gave me a new perspective. Not all of these readings were assigned to me in a class setting, some were recommended by friends, others I stumbled upon while doing class-related research. The content is mixed, covering design, mutual aid, capitalism, and everything inbetween.</p>
